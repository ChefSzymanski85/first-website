      <h2>Hi there! I'm Mark Szymanski!</h2>
      <h3>I am an IT student living in Chapel Hill, NC</h3>
      <p>As a former professional chef, I am looking to utilize the skills I've learned
       in the kitchen to become a web developer. I have adapted a strong worth ethic
       and excellent communication skills. Now I've decided to use my passion as a chef
       to start a career for my other passion, software development!</p>

       <p>Some of my interests include:<p>
         <ul>
           <li>Cooking all sorts of different food from all around the world</li>
           <li>Watching sports and playing fantasy sports</li>
           <li>Video Games</li>
         </ul> <!-- Unordered list to show my interest -->

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <article>
      <p>After working for a bit after high school, I attended Culinary School at Wake
        Technical Community College. For eight years I worked in kitchens, working my way
        up from pantry line cook, to banquet sous chef. I had a lot of great experiences in
        my culinary journey, but decided it was time for a change. My passion for software
        development, as well as a hope for a normal life, led me to studying at Thinkful. I
        am now learning so much about software development, and hope to be a full stack
        developer by the end of the year!</p>
